            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Greetings! I'm KT, a passionate and dedicated software engineering 
                student with a lifelong fascination for computers and complex 
                algorithms. From the early days of my childhood, I've been 
                captivated by the intricate world of technology, and that curiosity 
                has evolved into a driving force in my journey as a full-stack 
                Java software engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                My path to this point has been an interesting one, marked by twists 
                and turns that have ultimately fueled my commitment to this field. 
                While my journey began with bits and pieces of coding during my high 
                school days, it wasn't until the pandemic disrupted my sprouting 
                career in hairdressing that I truly immersed myself in the world of 
                software engineering. This pivotal moment compelled me to seize the 
                opportunity and embark on a serious exploration of this captivating 
                domain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Presently, I'm pursuing a double major in Software Engineering and 
                Computer Science at Western Governors University, a testament to my 
                dedication to honing my skills and knowledge. Through this formal 
                education, I've gained a solid foundation that complements the 
                self-study I've undertaken over the years.
            </p>
            <p>
                My expertise extends beyond the classroom, as I've delved into 
                various projects that highlight my passion for full-stack Java 
                development. While some of these projects are still in the 
                development phase, they reflect my commitment to crafting efficient 
                and innovative solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                One area that holds a special place in my heart is web accessibility. 
                While I understand that fresh graduates are continually evolving, 
                I'm particularly passionate about making digital experiences 
                inclusive for all users. I firmly believe that technology should 
                empower everyone, regardless of their abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey has included participation in game jams, project 
                contributions, and hackathons, experiences that have fostered my 
                collaborative spirit and problem-solving acumen. I approach each 
                challenge by dissecting its core elements, embracing the "Who What 
                Where Why and How" to unravel its complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I move forward, I remain steadfast in my commitment to coding 
                practices that prioritize legibility, accessibility, and clear 
                communication. I'm excited to contribute my unique perspective and 
                enthusiasm to the dynamic world of software engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm genuinely proud of the winding path that has led me here, and 
                I'm excited to embrace the future's opportunities and challenges 
                with open arms. Join me as we journey into the ever-evolving 
                landscape of technology.
            </p>
